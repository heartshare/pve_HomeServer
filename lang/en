lng_welc="Welcome"
lng_intr="Introduction"
lng_intrtxt="Before we can start we need some information about your proxmoxsystem and your network. Please make sure that all information is correct, otherwise this script cannot be executed completely or only incorrectly, and the configuration of your Proxmox system, as well as the creation and configuration of containers and virtual machines will not work.\n\nThe use of this script requires a new, not configured Proxmox installation."
lng_netr="networkrobot"
lng_netrtxt="It makes sense in a network to create a so-called network robot.\n\nA network robot has administrator rights on all devices in the network. So all automated tasks can be done with one user.\n\nOf course such a user must be assigned an extremely secure password. When you create such a user, give it a unique name such as netrobot."
lng_spwd="Secure password"
lng_spwdtxt="This password is randomly created by this script, deleted after the script ends and cannot be recovered. For this reason you should write it down. For this purpose it is best to use a password manager like safeincloud.\n\nAutomatically generated password: $networkrobotpw \n\nYou can easily check the security of your password e.g. on the website https://password.kaspersky.com/de/."
lng_netinf="Network infrastructure"
lng_pvepwd="Proxmox root password"
lng_pvepwdtxt="What is the root password from your Proxmox server?"

lng_netrpwdtxt="What password did you choose for your networkrobot?\n\nPrefill with the automatically generated password."
lng_gwr="Gateway/Router"
lng_gwrtxt="What gateway/router are you using?"

lng_vlan="VLAN"
lng_vlantxt="Do you use VLANs in your network?"
lng_vlantxt1="What is the VLAN ID to be used for your server network?\nDefault = 1"
lng_vlantxt2="What is the VLAN ID to be used for your smart home network?"
lng_vlantxt3="What is the VLAN ID to use for your guest network?"
lng_vlaninfo="A Virtual Local Area Network '(VLAN)' is a logical network that sits on top of a physical LAN and can provide increased flexibility, performance and security. VLANs can be used to divide physical LANs into logical subnets that are isolated from each other. Subdividing LANs is not an end in itself, but is also intended to optimize performance and security.\n\That's why you should consider using VLANs."
lng_mailconf="Email configuration"
lng_mailconftxt="To which email address should notifications and system reports be sent?"

lng_mailconftxt6="Is TLS/SSL used for the connection?"
lng_nasconf="Storage and NAS configuration"
lng_nasconftxt="Is there a NAS '(Qnap, Synology, etc.)' on your network?"
lng_nasconftxt1="What is the IP address of your NAS?"
lng_nassearch="Your NAS is searched on the network ..."
lng_nasconferror="The specified IP address is unreachable. Please check if the NAS is turned on and connected to the network."
lng_nasconfman="Is this NAS a Synology DiskStation?"
lng_nasconfinfo="In this script, two shared folders are needed on the NAS. Create the following folders and assign read/write permissions to user $varrobotname.\n\nbackups\nmedia\n\nHave you created these folders and assigned read/write permissions to your network robot $varrobotname?"
lng_nasconfinfoerror="If the network robot does not have read/write permissions to the folders, this configuration script cannot work properly, sorry.\n\nThe script will be terminated."
lng_nasconfinfo1="It is recommended to install a NAS in a private network. Since you don't own or want to specify a NAS the installation of some servers is not available."
lng_lxcconf="Container configuration"
lng_lxcconftxt="Select the servers to install from the list."
lng_endconf="Configuration completion"
lng_endconftxt="The configuration is finished, the script will now run with your defaults. Depending on which containers you have chosen for the installation, further user input will be required.\n\nShould Proxmox be configured according to your defaults?"
lng_abort="Abort"
lng_aborttxt="No changes will be made to your Proxmox server. If you want to configure it through this script, you need to run it again."
