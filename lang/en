intr="Introduction
intrtxt=Before we can start we need some information about your proxmoxsystem and your network. Please make sure that all information is correct, otherwise this script cannot be executed completely or only incorrectly, and the configuration of your Proxmox system, as well as the creation and configuration of containers and virtual machines will not work.\n\nThe use of this script requires a new, not configured Proxmox installation.
netr="networkrobot"
netrtxt="It makes sense in a network to create a so-called network robot.\n\nA network robot has administrator rights on all devices in the network. So all automated tasks can be done with one user.\n\nOf course such a user must be assigned an extremely secure password. When you create such a user, give it a unique name such as netrobot."
spwd="Secure password"
spwdtxt="This password is randomly created by this script, deleted after the script ends and cannot be recovered. For this reason you should write it down. For this purpose it is best to use a password manager like safeincloud.\n\nAutomatically generated password: $networkrobotpw \n\nYou can easily check the security of your password e.g. on the website https://password.kaspersky.com/de/."

vlantxt2="What is the VLAN ID to be used for your smart home network?"
vlantxt3="What is the VLAN ID to use for your guest network?"
vlaninfo="A Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) is a logical network that sits on top of a physical LAN and can provide increased flexibility, performance and security. VLANs can be used to divide physical LANs into logical subnets that are isolated from each other. Subdividing LANs is not an end in itself, but is also intended to optimize performance and security.\n\That's why you should consider using VLANs."

nasconfinfoerror="If the network robot does not have read/write permissions to the folders, this configuration script cannot work properly, sorry.\n\nThe script will be terminated."
nasconfinfo1="It is recommended to install a NAS in a private network. Since you don't own or want to specify a NAS the installation of some servers is not available."

endconf="Configuration completion"
endconftxt="The configuration is finished, the script will now run with your defaults. Depending on which containers you have chosen for the installation, further user input will be required.\n\nShould Proxmox be configured according to your defaults?"
